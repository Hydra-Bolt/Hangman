## Prerequisites
- Python version 3.7 or higher
- Tkinter library installed
- Cartograph CF font installed

## Running the Game
1. Open the project folder in a code editor such as VScode or PyCharm
2. Navigate to the `CODE` folder
3. Run the `HangmanMain_VS.py` file if using VScode or `HangmanMain_IDE.py` if using an alternative IDE

## Login Information

## Instructions for Playing the Game:
- Start the game by running the script.
- You will be prompted to enter your username and password to login. If you do not have an account, you can create one by clicking on the 'register' button.
- Once you are logged in, you will be presented with a screen displaying a blank word, with spaces representing the letters of the secret word.
- You can now start guessing the letters of the secret word by typing them in the input box and clicking on the 'guess' button.
- If your guess is correct, the letter will be displayed in the appropriate space of the secret word.
- If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a guess and the hangman image will change to reflect the number of remaining guesses.
- The game ends when you have successfully guessed all the letters of the secret word, or you have run out of guesses.
- If you successfully guess all the letters, you will be declared the winner and prompted to play again or exit the game.
- If you run out of guesses, you will lose the game and prompted to play again or exit the game.
- You can view the high scores after wining the game or by becoming an admin.
